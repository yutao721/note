 ## 1.基本句型 

|简拼|全拼|中文|
|:---|:---|:---|
|S|subject|主语|
|V|verb|动词|
|O|object|宾语|
|C|complement|补语|

* S+V 主语+动语
* S+V+O 主语+动词+宾语
* S+V+C 主语+动词+补语
* S+V+O+O 主语+动词+宾语+宾语
* S+V+O+C 主语+动词+宾语+补语

 ### 1.1 S+V(主语+动词) 

* 一个完整的名子必须有主语和动词
* 主语是句子所要描述的对象
* 动词是叙述的主要内容
* 如果动作可以独立发生，不涉及到别的人和物就叫不及物动词
* 不管及物动词还是不及物动词都要承担叙述任务

```
My watch stopped.
```

 ### 1.2 S+V+O(主语+动词+宾语) 

* 如果动作必须作用在另一个对象身上，这个动词就是及物动词，接受动作的对象就是宾语

```
I love you.
```

 ### 1.3 S+V+C(主语+动词+补语) 

* 在英语单词中,那么解释为是的动词是空的，本身没有意义
* `Be`动词可以不翻译,没有实际意义,但是动词不能丢掉
* 解释为是的动词不能丢掉，但没有实际意义，只能用来连接，所以又叫连系动词(Linking Verb)
* 动词后面的部分才是替代动词的叙述功能，起到了补充的作用，称为补语(Complement)

```
I am happy.
```

 ### 1.4 S+V+O+C(主语+动词+宾语+补语) 

* 主语补语是告诉读者是什么,宾语补语是告诉读者宾语是什么
* 看看宾语和补语之间是否能加`be`动词是判断`S+V+O+C`句型的方式
